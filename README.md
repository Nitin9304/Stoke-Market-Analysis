Stock market analysis helps investors make informed decisions by evaluating data to identify profitable opportunities. It includes fundamental analysis, which assesses a companyâ€™s intrinsic value through financial statements, valuation ratios like P/E, and macroeconomic factors, making it suitable for long-term investments. Technical analysis, on the other hand, studies historical price trends and trading volumes using tools like moving averages and RSI for short-term trading. Key aspects include market trends, sector performance, risk management, and the influence of news or sentiment. By minimizing risks and promoting informed strategies, stock market analysis supports wealth creation and effective navigation of complex financial markets.
